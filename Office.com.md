If you've finished the Logging into Windows checksheet, reply to this email with step-by-step instructions on how to log into Windows on a school computer. Pretend that you are describing the process to a new student who also needs to choose a new password. Write the email as a numbered list of steps.

完成这项任务，让你不要打扰你的同伴。 如果您已完成登录Windows检查表，请回复此电子邮件，并附上关于如何在学校计算机上登录Windows的分步说明。 假装你正在向一个新学生描述这个过程，而且还需要选择新的密码。 将电子邮件写成编号的步骤列表。 如果您尚未完成检查单，请先静音完成，然后再处理此作业。
